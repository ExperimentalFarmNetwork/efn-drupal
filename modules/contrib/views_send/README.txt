The messages are queued in a spool table and delivered only on cron.
You can control how many messages will be send per cron run.

CONFIGURATION

General settings can be configured at: Site Configuration > Views Send

USAGE

 1. Create a view and add at least one column containing e-mail addresses.
 2. [Optional] Expose Views filters to let the user easily build list of
    recipients using UI.
 3. Add the "Global: Send e-mail" field to your view. This field provides the checkboxes
    that allow the user to select multiple rows.
 4. Save the view, load the page, use exposed filters to build the list, select
    all or some rows and choose "Send e-mail".
 5. Fill the message form to configure the e-mail. Use tokens to personalize
    your e-mail.
 6. Preview and send the message.

DEPENDENCIES & INTEGRATION

 * Views Send depends on Views.
 * The module integrates features from:

    rich HTML messages and/or use attachments.

    into the subject or body of the message. Note that row-based tokens are
    available even if Tokens module is disabled.

    for when emails are sent and/or placed in the spool.
