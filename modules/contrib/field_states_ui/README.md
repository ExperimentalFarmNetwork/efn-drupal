Field States UI
===============

Field States UI allows sites builders with minimal PHP/Dev skills to configure the <a href='https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/core%21includes%21common.inc/function/drupal_process_states/8.1.x'>Field States API</a>. This lets you configure a field to for example hide if another field has a certain value or hasn't been filled. While doing it via PHP can be be more powerful the UI can be very handy and in some cases quicker. Originally developed for <a href='https://metchosinkarate.ca>Metchosin Karate</a> for their student signup forms.
