This module will geocode just about anything you throw at it including addresses, GPX files, geo-tagged images, and KML files.

It is commonly used to automatically geocode <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/addressfield">Addressfield</a> addresses into <a href="/project/geofield">Geofield</a> points for display on <a href="/project/openlayers">Openlayers Maps</a>. It also supports the <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/geolocation">geolocation</a>, and <a href="http://www.drupal.org/project/location">location</a> modules.

This module also makes available an API to convert the information you already have into geographic information. It support a variety of input formats and runs them through pluggable backends to produce geographic information. In addition to Latitude / Longitude points, this API also supports more complex geographies such as lines and polygons.

If you'd like to help improve the module your patches and co-maintenance are welcome!
