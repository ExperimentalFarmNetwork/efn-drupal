<strong>IMPORTANT!: Since 8.x-1.2 the Leaflet module itself contains the "Leaflet Markecluster" submodule</strong>, that integrates the <a href="https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet.markercluster" title="Leaflet Markercluster Js library" target="_blank">Leaflet Markercluster Js library (version 1.4.1)</a>.

<strong>IMPORTANT!: (warning before upgrading from 8.x-1.2 to 8.x-1.3 version)</strong>
Leaflet Markecluster settings will be lost upgrading from 8.x-1.2 to 8.x-1.3 version.
Thus you are invited to store them before the upgrade, and reapply them manually, after it. Sorry for that. (<a href="https://www.drupal.org/project/leaflet/issues/3033668">more info</a>).


Please refer to the README file included into the project for all the details, including help on installation, configuration and usage.
