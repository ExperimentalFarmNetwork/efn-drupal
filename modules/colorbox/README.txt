   Link: https://www.drupal.org/documentation/install/modules-themes/modules-8
2. Download and unpack the Colorbox plugin in "libraries".
    Make sure the path to the plugin file becomes:
    "libraries/colorbox/jquery.colorbox-min.js"
   Link: https://github.com/jackmoore/colorbox/archive/master.zip
   Drush users can use the command "drush colorbox-plugin".
3. Go to "Administer" -> "Extend" and enable the Colorbox module.


Configuration:
-------------
Go to "Configuration" -> "Media" -> "Colorbox" to find
all the configuration options.


Add a custom Colorbox style to your theme:
----------------------------------------
The easiest way is to start with either the default style or one of the
example styles included in the Colorbox JS library download. Simply copy the entire
style folder to your theme and rename it to something logical like "mycolorbox".
Inside that folder are both a .css and .js file, rename both of those as well to match
your folder name: i.e. "colorbox_mycolorbox.css" and "colorbox_mycolorbox.js"

Add entries in your theme's .info file for the Colorbox CSS/JS files:

stylesheets[all][] = mycolorbox/colorbox_mycolorbox.css
scripts[] = mycolorbox/colorbox_mycolorbox.js

Go to "Configuration" -> "Media" -> "Colorbox" and select "None" under
"Styles and Options". This will leave the styling of Colorbox up to your theme.
Make any CSS adjustments to your "colorbox_mycolorbox.css" file.


Drush:
------
A Drush command is provides for easy installation of the Colorbox
plugin itself.

% drush colorbox-plugin

The command will download the plugin and unpack it in "libraries/".
It is possible to add another path as an option to the command, but not
recommended unless you know what you are doing.
